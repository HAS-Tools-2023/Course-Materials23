# Week 13: Improving documentation and code structure
This week you will be revising and resubmitting your first graded code to improve the documentation and overall structure of your code. 
Please see the guidelines below. As with the previous graded code assignment I will be running and grading your script. It will generally be judged on the same rubric as last time however I have noted below the points that will be subtracted for specific missing elements.

## Assignment 13: 
You can update your code however you would like to make it readable and well documented. You should also refer to my previous comments in your script and make sure you address all of my previous comments. 

At a minimum you new script should:  
*Numbers in () indicate the amount that will automatically be subtracted if you are missing this element*
1. Code must run for me or I will return it to you without a grade
2. All of your data must be read use Rest APIs to get data and you should not use local data (-0.5)
3. Must have at least 2 user defined functions: 
  - Function must have doc strings that follow standard formatting guidelines, include a short title, longer description and describe all inputs and outputs (-0.5)
  - Function can't just be to take the mean or get the USGS data exactly as we did in class need to do something more to update it (e.g. adding parameters and outputs) or add additional functions if you choose to use those (-1)
4. All user input should be in a single block at the top of the code (-0.5)
5. There should be a ‘forecast_date’ input at the top and the user should be able to change the date and get a forecast and plots for whatever week they enter (-1)

You should use chatgpt (either through vs code or online) to improve your code. However, I request that first you take a pass through your code on your own and that you document in your markdown what you gained from ChatGPT.  

### What to submit: 
1. Your python script after you worked on it and before you got help from ChatGPT (lastname_firstdraft_hw13.py)
2. Your final python script that you would like me to grade. You cana have help from ChatGPT on this one (lastname_hw13.py)
3. A mardown file with the following: 
   1. A reflection on what you changed from the last version to this one, and where you think your code could use improvement
   2. A reflection on how chatGPT improved your code and if you found it useful.
